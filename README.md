## 🎯 Introduction
### Data Reconciliation & Anomaly Detection
This Streamlit app performs data reconciliation and anomaly detection on historical and real-time data. The app allows users to upload CSV files containing historical and real-time data, processes them based on user input, and provides a reconciled dataset along with anomaly detection results.

## 🎥 Demo

## 💡 Inspiration
This challenge involved around data sets and we were intrested in exploring usage of AI in data space, hence picked this challenge.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Upload historical and real-time data.
Input composite keys, value keys, and date/time fields.
Detect anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm.
View and download the reconciled dataset.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
